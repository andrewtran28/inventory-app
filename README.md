An inventory management app that sorts and displays a video game library. The library is sorted by genre and platforms which can be chosen on the homepage. This project should demonstrate the CRUD methods (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for both video games and categories.

The database has been pre-populated with video game images provided by GameBomb API. Adding new games to the library will fetch new images from GameBomb based on the game title.

Known issues
- Deleting the 'Other' platform crashes the app.
